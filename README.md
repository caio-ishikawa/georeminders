# GeoReminders #

A React Native application that allows users to place reminders in geographical space.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Landing Page</td>
     <td>Map page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

## The problem ##

I usually have a hard time remembering to buy guitar strings, to text a loved one when I reached my destination, or to buy a specific cleaning product for my apartment. 
Writing it down on my phone only helps so much, as I don't have the habit of looking at my notes very often, and most of my activites don't accompany a set of pre-written instructions or a list of items to acquire.


## The solution ##

It's as easy as placing a pin on the map.

Don't want to forget to buy strings? Place a pin on the store and get reminded once you get within a certain distance from it.

### Technologies ###

- React Native
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB

## TODO ##

- Calculate distance between user and pins.
- Limit free-tier users to 1 pin at a time.
